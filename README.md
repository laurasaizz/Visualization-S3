# Visualization of $S^3$
The goal of this project is to exploit established techniques for Euclidean embeddings of finite metric spaces, which approximately preserve given pairwise distances. This enables to turn subsets of $S^3$ in many ways into a finite metric space and to explore visually its structure by inspecting the  3-dimensional Euclidean embedding with minimal metric distortion.
